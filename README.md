# Bootstrap script for Asterisk

This script will install dependencies and then install Asterisk 16 on you linux machine.  

i have tested it on Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS but it should work on other versions too.   

Just download the Bootstrap_Asterisk.sh file and run it.

## Usage :

`./Bootstrap_Asterisk.sh`

## Ansible Playbook :

You can download the `Ansible_Playbook.yaml` file to run it on remote machines with the help of Ansible.
